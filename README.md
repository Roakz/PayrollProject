<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This Payroll console app was written to consolidate as many of the basic principles of programming in C# in the simplest way possible. I tried to incorporate as many of the basic principles as I could. In the section Below I will explain and point out these principles to demonstrate my understanding and show where they have been used in the code. There are also a couple that weren't included, that I realize are also important to C#, and as such I will also give an overview these to demonstrate my understanding of them.

As C# is an object orientated langauge. The application is split into 6 classes (Program, Staff, Manager, Admin, PaySlip and FileReader). These classes are essentially templates that are used to create objects that interact with each other in a typical object orientated fashion.

The application runs in the console and accepts input from the user to gather the year and month that the payslips are being generated for. It then reads througn a text file of users and there roles to gather the required staffing information and requests that we input the hours worked for each employee. It then prints a brief summary and moves on to the next staff on the list from the file. It has now generated a payslip for the staff memeber and printed these to a file which can be found in the Debug directory where the staff input file is also found.
